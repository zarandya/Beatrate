**Beatrate is work in progress. Coming soon on F-Droid and Google Play.**

Beatrate is a music player that detects the beat of songs, and synchronises playback to (a multiple of) a target rate chosen by the user.
The target rate may be the rhythm for a sports activity such as running cadence or rowing rate.
Adjusting the tempo of music to the target rate will help the user maintain a steady rhythm.
